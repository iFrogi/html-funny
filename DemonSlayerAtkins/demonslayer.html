   My website is about the anime Demon Slayer.
   The story is about a boy who comes home to find his family aten by creatures called Demons. 
   They are very strong, and feast on humans to continue on.
   After this tragedy, he learns his sister survived the attack, but is now a demon.
   In disbelief, he learns the only people who may be able to help him fix his sister are demons.
   He then trains to be stronger and learns a Breathing Technique, which he then uses to pass the trial and become a Demon Slayer, in hopes of saving his sister.
   After many battles, and close calls with fate, the story still begs the question, will he ever save his sister and be able to live happy? </p>

<h1> The MAIN CHARACTER</h1>
<p> The main character's name is Tanjiro Kamado. His family has a long history of hard work invovling coal, which he often did before the attack. He specializes in Water breathing, but as the story progresses, he begins to learn Sun Breathing, the breathing style that inspired them all!</p>
<body> <h1>THE MANGA</h1>
<p>The manga is the same general story, but more complete then the Anime. It has a lot more content currently, as the manga started at  February 15, 2016.  </p>
